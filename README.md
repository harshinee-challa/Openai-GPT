# Custom GPT Assistant Model

## Overview

This repository houses a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model implemented in JavaScript, 
specifically using the GPT-3.5 architecture from OpenAI. The model is designed to function as a conversational assistant, 
leveraging OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities.

## Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure to install the following dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

- **NodeJS**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
- **OpenAI npm**: Library for interfacing with the OpenAI API. Install using the following command:
  ```cmd
  npm install openai
  ```
- **Readline npm**: Allows reading input from the command line. Install using the following command:
  ```cmd
   npm install readline
  ```
- **fs npm**: File system module for interacting with the file system. Install using the following command:
  ```cmd
  npm install fs
  ```
- **dotenv npm**: Load environment variables from a .env file. Install using the following command:
  ```cmd
  npm install dotenv
  ```

## Getting Started

To use this custom GPT Assistant model, you need to set up your OpenAI API key. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

```.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and the API key is set up, you can run the project to interact with the GPT Assistant. Execute the following command:

```cmd
node runAssistant.js
```

This will launch the application, allowing you to input queries and receive responses generated by the GPT-3.5 model.

Feel free to customize and extend the functionality of the GPT Assistant according to your specific use case.
